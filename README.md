# Amortised Loan Schedule

## What?

* A way to generate loan schedules

## Why?

* Exposed to an issue currently, where we want to be able to dynamically restructure schedules.
* Mambu don't offer this, so we can approximate
* The best solution is to move to generating your own schedule
* This will unluck the ability to do whatever we want
* Finally, because this is my project, in my time, it can be done in F# ðŸ«¶
